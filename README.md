# Summer of Nix 2025

Summer of Nix is a coordinated effort to support selected free and open source software (FOSS) projects, by making them available on NixOS.
It is funded by the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet (NGI)](https://www.ngi.eu/) initiative through the [NLNet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/) and the [NixOS Foundation](https://github.com/NixOS/foundation).

This northern-hemisphere-summer program is designed for students and early-career professionals.
It is an opportunity to:
- Practice disciplined software development with Nix in an organisational setting
- Work with a dedicated team of experienced maintainers
- Contribute to the public good and receive some payment for it

Participation in Summer of Nix can also be a pathway to attractive jobs in software development.

Learn more about Nix on [nix.dev](https://nix.dev/).
Follow [updates on Summer of Nix on the NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/events/summer-of-nix/45).

## Goals

The program is intended for participants to **work, learn, and meet**:

- Improving the deployment story of [software projects funded by the NLnet Foundation](https://nlnet.nl/project/)

  Just writing the code is not enough: Programs have to be easy to obtain and run to be widely adopted.
  Getting complex software to work reliably on a whim is the aspiration for Summer of Nix.

  As a participant, you will write Nix derivations, NixOS modules, integration tests, and documentation.
  And you will solve a lot of tricky problems on the way.

- Skill-sharing among participants

  Making computers useful for a mass audience requires diverse skills and broad knowledge, and no one person has it all.

  As a participant, you will learn from – and teach – your peers about widely used programming languages, software testing, technical writing, web design, and the Nix ecosystem with its various tools.
  You will closely collaborate with a mentor and the project team on a regular schedule.

- Growing the Nix community

  As a participant, you will join a community of [more than 700 active contributors](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulse/monthly).
  You will engage in an open source software development workflow and take part in public technical discussion.

  After successful participation, you will be invited to NixCon 2025, a conference for Nix users and developers from all over the world.
  And you will be afforded an opportunity for exposure with potential employers for whom Nix is a core strength.

### Schedule

- Application phase: 2025-04-17 to 2025-05-12

  After the application closes the team will select up to 10 candidates for interviews.

- Interview phase: 2025-05-19 to 2025-05-28

  Selected candidates will have a video call with team members.

- Final selection: 2025-05-31

  A contract offer will be sent to 2 to 3 applicants for confirmation.

## Technical requirements

Effective remote collaboration requires being able to simultaneously share your screen, view others' screens, talk to each other, and compile software.
This is only possible with sufficiently performant hardware, and therefore it's a condition for participation:

- Video camera
- Headphones and reasonable-quality microphone
- Consistently low-noise environment
- Enough processing power for multiple concurrent video streams
- Sufficient and stable bandwidth throughout multiple hours of video call

From the organisers' experience, mobile data is unlikely to suffice.

Please ask a friend to make a test call on [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) to ensure that they can see your screen and hear you well.

## Questions and answers

### How to get notifications and updates?

Notifications are posted in the public Matrix room [Summer of Nix Announcements](https://matrix.to/#/#summer-of-nix-announce:matrix.org).
Set up your [Matrix client](https://matrix.org/try-matrix/) to receive push notifications on new messages.

News about the program are published in the [Summer of Nix Discourse category](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/events/summer-of-nix/45).
[Subscribe](https://meta.discourse.org/t/notifications-primer/228439) to receive push notifications or emails on new messages.

### Do I have to pay taxes on my stipend?

It depends.
**You are responsible for observing the laws that apply to you when receiving payments.**

The stipend is compensation for work towards a non-profit cause.
This means that in some jurisdictions it may be exempt from income tax, value-added tax (VAT), or from counting towards social insurance or health insurance obligations.

In some jurisdictions you may have to register a business to legally account for receiving payments.

Note that the stipend amount is exactly what the NixOS Foundation can pay.
If you have to process VAT, the gross expense for the NixOS Foundation still must be the stipend amount, even if you put "reverse charge" on the invoice.

### Is this related to Google Summer of Code?

No, Summer of Nix is an independent program organised by the NixOS Foundation.
It is funded by the European Commission via the NLnet Foundation.

Summer of Nix was originally modeled after Google Summer of Code, but has developed its own profile.
We use the [purchasing power parity data](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends#total_stipend_amount) from Google Summer of Code to calculate our stipends.

### Why does this NGI-sponsored program use this or that software?

We do our best to select free and open source, privacy-respecting software.
But this is not a hard constraint, nor the only criterion.

We use:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for development and public technical discussion
- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) for private, ephemeral, or real-time communication
- [Notion](https://notion.so/) for accounting

As a participant, you will need an account on each of these services.

## Testimonials

> I had been a Nixpkgs contributor for about an year when I took part in Summer of Nix, so this was a great opportunity to go a step deeper into the Nix ecosystem.
> For me more importantly than the technical outcomes of this program, I met some talented and passionate folks from the community, whom I'm still in contact with today.
> I came to get more involved with Nix, Nixpkgs, NixOS and everything around it, and I didn't expect this to be a foundational stepping stone in my career journey.
> This does come from the on-paper value of the program, but more so from the latent knowledge gained thanks to my mentors and peers with their experience in a diverse set of fields.
> I'm lucky to have had a chance to contribute to things that I love, and very grateful for everyone involved in this program being as supportive and caring as they were.

> I participated as a mentor in the first two Summers of Nix.
> This gave me an opportunity to help introduce others to the ecosystem and gain experience leading a globally distributed team.
> The greatest outcome was the joy of [seeing some of the participants stick around](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY66f8epAE8) and grow to become major contributors.
> The program is an effective way to create value in open source as well as make the Nix ecosystem stronger, with a focus on the people that make up the community.
