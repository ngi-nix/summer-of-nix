# 2024 Summer of Nix: Call for mob facilitators

We are looking for mob facilitators to run 160 hours of [remote mob programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/) sessions over 13 weeks between May and September 2024 for this year’s [Summer of Nix](https://github.com/ngi-nix/summer-of-nix).

# Requirements

You should have extensive experience with mob programming. You should be confident that you could bring a group of developers who are mob programming novices to success within a few weeks. This requires leadership and programming skills. Nix experience is a bonus.

Your main responsibility will be to assemble a team and facilitate their work. You will be in charge of the process — such as keeping to the schedule and following software development best practices — as well as the outcome of your team’s work: getting selected free and open source software (FOSS) to work reliably on a whim.

# Compensation and benefits

The Summer of Nix motto is **work, learn, and meet**:

- You will receive a stipend:
    - 5000 EUR for EU residents
    - Adjusted to purchasing power parity for residents of other countries
- You will likely learn many things about the Nix ecosystem
- You will expand your professional network
- You will get a free ticket for NixCon 2024
- Your blog posts, talks, or public appearances related to Summer of Nix will find an audience in the Nix community

# Working conditions

- You will publish an introduction of yourself as a facilitator, and set a schedule for your future mob.
- You will process mob member applications and select four people for your mob.
- You will facilitate mob programming sessions on your schedule.
- You will ensure that your mob is aligned with the program by participating in regular check-ins with program organisers and other mobs.
- Due to the nature of this project's collaboration model, your work results, including your contributions to technical discussion, will appear in publicly accessible places on the internet, such as GitHub, and remain there indefinitely.
