# 2024 Summer of Nix: Call for mob facilitators

We are looking for mob facilitators to run 160 hours of [remote mob programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/) sessions over 13 weeks between May and September 2024 for this year’s [Summer of Nix](https://github.com/ngi-nix/summer-of-nix).

Your task will be to assemble a team who may have no experience with mob programming and guide them into successful collaboration and productivity.
You will be in charge of the process, including keeping to the schedule and following software development best practices — as well as the outcome of the team’s work: getting selected free and open source software (FOSS) to work reliably on a whim.

# Requirements

You must meet the [general eligibility requirements](./README.md#eligibility).
You should have **extensive experience with mob programming**.
This requires **leadership and programming skills**.
Extended Nix experience is a bonus.

An *optimal* applicant would have:

- Command of at least two widely-used programming languages
- Firm grasp of software development best practices
- Excellent control of Git, including rewriting history and conflict resolution
- Team coaching experience
- Fluency with the Nix language and related tools

# Compensation and benefits

The Summer of Nix motto is **work, learn, and meet**:

- You will receive a stipend:
    - 5000 EUR for EU residents
    - [Adjusted to purchasing power parity](./stipends.md) for residents of other countries
- You will likely learn many things about the Nix ecosystem
- You will expand your professional network
- You will get a free ticket for NixCon 2024
- Your blog posts, talks, or public appearances related to Summer of Nix will find an audience in the Nix community

# Working conditions

- You will publish an introduction of yourself as a facilitator, and set a schedule for your future mob.
- You will process mob member applications and select four people for your mob.
- You will facilitate mob programming sessions on your schedule.
- You will ensure that your mob is aligned with the program by participating in regular check-ins with program organisers and other mobs.
- Due to the nature of this project's collaboration model, your work results, including your contributions to technical discussion, will appear in publicly accessible places on the internet, such as GitHub, and remain there indefinitely.
